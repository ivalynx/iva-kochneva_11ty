She is wearing a blue sweatshirt with a lynx design; only the upper portion of the image, including the animal's ears and forehead, is visible in the frame."

Hi! My name is Iva Kochneva. I take the general into its parts and reassemble the general from the parts.

I  [create websites](/websites) and beautiful emails, I do UI and UX design, and I do [hand embroidery](https://www.instagram.com/ivalynx_embroidery/).

I’m learning Bulgarian. I love folk tales, cats, and doing useful things.
