She is wearing a blue sweatshirt with a lynx design; only the upper portion of the image, including the animal's ears and forehead, is visible in the frame."

Hi! My name is Iva Kochneva. I take the general into its parts and reassemble the general from the parts.

I am a person with ASD. I was born in Tatarstan, lived in Russia, and emigrated to Bulgaria in 2021. I love folk tales, cats, and creating useful things.

I am a multi-functional person, and it is very important to me that what I do has the following characteristics:

1. The results are visible;
2. What I do must be applicable;
3. It is created primarily for a specific client;
4. It must be as convenient as possible for the client.
